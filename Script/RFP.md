# Request for Proposal (RFP)

## I.	Purpose of RFP
We are making a web page to distribute the code words among the students and those code words should not match with the other students in the same class.

## II.	Organization’s Background
Firstly, there is a way to give codewords by paper and distribute among students and mail themselves and it is used at the end of the course in a survey. As an instructor Dr. Hoot thought it was a long way, so we are working to make it in a professional way. We are about to create a survey in a web page. In that there will be a chance to generate keywords by the student and that will be mailed to them automatically after the completion of survey. Here, students who are in the same section couldn’t get the same keywords. Only instructor and admin can see the keywords generated to students. After the semester, they can be able to do survey using this keyword.

## III.	Basic Requirements:
As a student, after the survey he would get a codeword. He can use that codeword for a period. This time will be controlled by the professor who is taking that course. He can give access to a bunch of codewords for students. Admin will give manage all the information about the surveys, professor and students.
