In the first class we discussed with Dr. Hoot about the project he was expecting from us.

 # Meeting with Dr. Hoot (Aug, 27th) :

On Aug 27th for first time, I (Anurag) along with Sravya, Vyshnavi, Srimai met our client Dr. Hoot during class hours between 9:00 am to 9:55am.
- During this meet he gave us his requirements and what he expect at the end of the project.
- He had suggested what types of users we will have (students), how the admin function will work (login and password), who will control the function (professor), what device we will use (iPhone SE).
- Other than that, he had emailed us a list of 80 words to use it as our initial database and further in future he will create and give us more word sets.


# Meeting with Dr. Hoot (Sept, 4th):

On Sept,4th me (Ujjawal) along with Sravya and Vyshnavi went to meet Dr. Hoot at 1pm during his office hours. We discussed with him regarding the sketches we prepared and also the functunalities which we would be implementing in future and after watching all those and listing to us he suggested few chamges which are mentioned below:

- Since we are developing an ios app, so all the menu should be displayed at the bottom instead of top.
- After Instructor logs into their account, Instructor should be able to see that the logged in page belongs to Instructor(like lable or something)
- As a Instructor, he/she should be able to add courses and also add students to their particular courses.
- Insted of "SUBMIT" button, Dr. Hoot asked us to create a "GENERATE CODE" button.
- Once the instructor will generate the code, he/she should be able to view what percentage of students retrieved their code(like 10% students retrieved their codes or 0% students reytrieved their codes). If none of the students retrieved their codes then he/she may ask the students to start retrieving their codes.
- Also, as a instructor, I should not be able to know what code is assigned to which students, instead I should be able to know how many students retrieved their codes in terms of percentage.
