## Client Wish List:

After watching all our sketches and listing to us, Dr. Hoot suggested few changes which are mentioned below:

- Since we are developing an ios app, so all the menu should be displayed at the bottom instead of top.
- After Instructor logs into their account, Instructor should be able to see that the logged in page belongs to Instructor(like lable or something)
- As a Instructor, he/she should be able to add courses and also add students to their particular courses.
- Insted of "SUBMIT" button, Dr. Hoot asked us to create a "GENERATE CODE" button.
- Once the instructor will generate the code, he/she should be able to view what percentage of students retrieved their code(like 10% students retrieved their codes or 0% students reytrieved their codes). If none of the students retrieved their codes then he/she may ask the students to start retrieving their codes.
- Also, as a instructor, I should not be able to know what code is assigned to which students, instead I should be able to know how many students retrieved their codes in terms of percentage.
