#1 - what specifically did you contribute to updating the gantt chart?  Just changing it and recommitting shows that you can pull the repo, add a file, commit it locally, and push to the repo, but I can't see exactly what if any contribution you made. Please update your description and/or add information to the bottom of your submission (e.g. embed an image highlighting your work) so that I can see the value.

Do you want 2&3 grouped?  Updated is too general - use words like "I standardized the formatting on our Project Charter.  How many hours did these take you combined?  Looks less than 4 hours of work (for both). If I'm wrong, please come update me.

#4 - "updating" a file is way too general. What specifically did you contribute? Always explain your work in your submission and especially when linking to a binary file (like Excel), include an image of your work at the bottom of your submission.

I can tell you've been contributing - just remember I will grade only based on your documented submissions. Show clearly how you spent each 4 hours.
